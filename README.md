# Currently looking for help optimizing this workflow

### Alfred-Sony-AV-Control
An Alfred workflow for controlling Sony AV Receivers
Currently working for my AV Unit (IP Address 10.0.0.13)


### Looking for Help with fixing up workflow
Poorly designed workflow, but it does in fact work.


### Problems
- Ability to pass arguments quicker (ex. it's currently a pain to change the volume multiple times)
- Configuring IP Address of AV Unit

### Solutions
- Combine poorly written code into one library with the ability to modify user's IP address. (Thanks deanishe for suggestions!)
